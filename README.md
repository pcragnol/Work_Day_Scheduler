# Work_Day_Scheduler

## Description

For this project, I created a work day scheduler that allows a user to add and save calendar events to their work day. I made this project as an exercise in Moment.js, jQuery, Bootstrap, datasets, and local storage. I constructed a basic table that includes a text area and save button for each hour of the work day. I then assigned each text area and save button a corresponding two-digit "data-hour". This dataset works double duty by coloring each text area based on its relation to present time using the Moment.js 24-hour "HH" format, and also acting as a key when saving the text area content to local storage. jQuery's powerful JavaScript code library enables consise functions utilizing .each() and DOM traversal methods. Finanlly, the entire page is styled easily using Bootstrap's vast CSS code library.
